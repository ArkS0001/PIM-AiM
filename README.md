 Processing In Memory (PIM)

    Definition and Purpose: PIM is an emerging computing paradigm that places computation capabilities directly within memory chips. This approach addresses the limitations of the traditional von Neumann architecture, which relies on a separate CPU and memory, creating a bottleneck in data movement.
    Benefits: By enabling data to be processed within the memory, PIM significantly reduces latency and energy consumption. It’s especially advantageous for tasks requiring high data bandwidth, like machine learning, big data analytics, and real-time processing.
    Implementation: SK Hynix’s PIM architecture likely involves modifications in DRAM or NAND memory chips to include logic operations, allowing for data computations directly within the memory cells.

 Accelerator in Memory (AiM)

    Definition and Purpose: AiM is a specialized form of PIM where accelerators are embedded within memory chips. These accelerators are designed to optimize specific computational tasks, often focused on AI or deep learning functions, such as matrix multiplication or convolution operations.
    Benefits: By embedding accelerators, AiM reduces the data movement overhead and power consumption associated with transferring data between memory and CPU or GPU. This setup leads to faster processing times and more efficient handling of large-scale AI workloads.
    Application Areas: AiM is particularly suited for inference processing in AI applications, as it allows for the efficient handling of neural network computations. It could be a key technology in edge AI, where energy efficiency and latency are crucial.

Processing In Memory (PIM)

PIM technology embeds computational capabilities directly within memory chips, reducing data movement between memory and processing units (like CPUs and GPUs). This design is valuable for tasks requiring high bandwidth and low latency, such as AI workloads and big data analytics. SK Hynix’s PIM technology, based on GDDR6 DRAM, enables significant energy savings (up to 80%) and up to 16 times faster processing compared to standard DRAM configurations. These improvements are primarily due to reduced reliance on data transfer between separate processing and memory units​
